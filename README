This program hasn't been tested yet.  Sampling rate needs to be resolved.

Added "accel_test"
Takes in analog values from ADXL335 Accelerometer (lilypad accelerometer from Sparkfun) and converts all 3 axis to "g" values.

A graph of the accelerometer in action (x axis "flick test") is included!
y axis is ADC Values while x axis is the sample number.
